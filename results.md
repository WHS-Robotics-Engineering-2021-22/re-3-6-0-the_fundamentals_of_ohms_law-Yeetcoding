Total current: 3.32 mA
R = V/I   R=5/3.32   R=1506 Ohms
To find the LED resistance, we have to look at the resistor. The resistor has a resistance of 1k Ohms, and so the LED has a resistance of 506 Ohms, and this is found by taking the
total resistance minus the resistor's restistance. So 1506-1000=506. 
I was right, I checked on the circut simulator. 
I changed the model of the LED to old-default-led, and it jumped from a voltage drop of 1.68 V to 1.81 V. The current also changed to 3.19 mA. I think this is happening because 
this LED is older, and has less conductive materials or its materials have been worn out. 

Randomly generated number: 6.39

V = 5 V
I = 6.39 mA

5 = (x + 506) * 6.39

R = 506 Ohms

True Resistance = 510 (confirmed by Circut Sim)
